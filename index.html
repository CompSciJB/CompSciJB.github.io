				A little about my education
			</H2>
			<p class="pText">
			For the last several years I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of two separate bachelor degrees at the University of Arizona while working in several internships for a greater portion of it. It has been a challenging time for me, especially due to the impacts of Covid-19, but I am happy to say that as of May 2021 I am officially a graduate of the Computer Science and the EAS-Chinese Language programs!<br><br>

			When talking about Computer Science, I can look back and see several years of trails that have taken me through some of the hardest challenges I have ever faced, but coming out on top I have learned that I have the foundation to make it far in this career as well as the fact that I will never stop learning while in this career field. There will always be new puzzles to solve and software to build and I am incredibly excited to be a part of a field that will never cease to expand.  <br> <br>

			When talking about Chinese language, I can see the growth and change that developing the ability to speak a secondary language has had upon me. It has not only opened my eyes to the difficulties of what it is like to learn a foreign language, but it has also made a more understanding and compassionate person as well as a better communicator. I hope to keep learning the language in my personal life as a hobby going forward.
