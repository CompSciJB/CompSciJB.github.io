				An Education Reflection
			</H2>
			<p class="pText">
			For the last five years I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of two separate bachelor’s degrees at the University of Arizona. During this time, I additionally was in some form of internship more often than not. It has been a challenging time for me, especially due to the impacts of Covid-19, but I am happy to say that as of May 2021 I am officially a graduate of the Computer Science program and the East Asian Studies-Chinese Language program!<br><br>

			When talking about Computer Science, I can look back and see several years of trails that have taken me through some of the hardest challenges I have ever faced, but coming out on top I have learned that I have the foundation to make it far in this career as well as the fact that I will never stop learning while in this career field. There will always be new puzzles to solve and software to build and I am incredibly excited to be a part of a field that will never cease to expand.  <br> <br>

			I view this degree as the most challenging aspect of my education thus far due to how much work had to be put into each course. I definitely learned critical thinking and how to find and use resources effectively. I feel like this degree path out of the two of them required the most hours spent attempting to solve singular problems as well as finding innovative and unique ways to solve each problem. I chose and love computer science because of this exact phenomenon, I think that the puzzles placed in front of me are one of the most fun experiences to solve. When I finally get the code compiling and the logic working after hours of toiling away, the feeling of gratification I get from seeing the hard work come together as a functional piece of software is unparallel to anything I have discovered in life yet. I have become proficient in programming and can write in over 12 programming languages now from Python and Java to C and assembly, but I will never forget how hard it was for me to learn the basic concepts because only looking back now do I see how simple they were yet frustrating to me at that moment. That lesson itself taught me how things in life might seem incredibly hard now, but after some practice and perseverance I will eventually look back upon it as a simple trial that would no longer even phase me. It also gives me empathy and understanding to those that are just learning something new because of how hard I struggled to get up those same hills.  <br> <br>

			When talking about Chinese language, I can see the growth and change that developing the ability to speak a secondary language has had upon me.  It has not only opened my eyes to the difficulties of what it is like to learn a foreign language, but it has also made me a more understanding and compassionate person as well as a better communicator. I have a few people in my life who do not have the ability to speak fluent English but can speak Mandarin, and so by learning Chinese I have gotten to know them so much better as time has gone on. When I started everything was using hand signals and the bits of English they know. As time progressed it has developed into the use of more and more Chinese until now, where I can hold conversations to a degree. I am nowhere near fluent, but I hope to keep learning the language in my personal life as a hobby going forward as well as continuing to develop my understanding of foreign cultures. <br> <br>

 			Learning Chinese has been a major contributor to increasing my memorization and overall memory-based abilities. It has helped me to develop the ability to store large amounts of information after only seeing it a few times, a skill that has gotten progressively better since the degree began. The courses in my East Asian Studies degree were not all language courses though and I think these were beneficial in their own ways. I have spent hours writing papers and reading through academic writings to understand meaning and draw conclusions properly. The degree path taught me how to construct arguments from written sources and accurately portray them upon paper. This is a skill that will be used in any job field regardless of where I am at. <br> <br>

			Looking to the future I am excited yet nervous to find out where my career will take me, but I am satisfied in knowing that the skills I have developed in the past five years will be foundational in my future success. I have learned discipline, time management, hard work, patience, compassion, and the ability to teach myself things when nobody else can. These skills are going to carry my career as well as my day to day life and I am more than excited to start putting them to the true test after college ended.

				<h2 class = "titles"> Job fair </h2>
				<p class="pText"> Due to the spread of Covid19 and how busy my schedule ended up during my final semester of undergrad, I was unable to attend a career fair this semester. I have however previously been to a career fair my sophomore year of college, but I did not particularly enjoy it. I believe that was due to my lack of knowledge at the time though. <br><br>

				What I learned from attending that job fair was that the competition is always going to be intense. There were at least three hundred people walking around that room talking to the different stands. I felt very small and also very inexperienced. I remember seeing the major name companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Intel to name a few and thinking how I will probably never be on par with the students who are going to get those jobs. <br><br>

				Having now almost finished my degrees, I look back and realize how much I have grown since then. I feel that if I were able to attend another career fair my lack of knowledge in the field would no longer be a problem. I have always enjoyed small talk and getting to know people and so the mingling and discussion aspect of the career fair is not difficult to me, but actually feels rather natural. <br><br>

				During my internship time with Tucson Electric Power I was also able to attend a private career fair event where my company brought in probably fifteen other companies in the energy business in other forms of technology and even sales. The goal was to help graduating interns whose co-op with TEP was ending to find a job and to give those who still had time a chance to get familiar with how those types of events work. I personally found that I was not too interested in many of the jobs presented and ended up room hopping to see the various stands. Only IBM really stood out to me, but I was still relatively fresh at TEP and so I did not apply. <br><br>

				I think at the end of the day the communication and on the spot questions you are asked during a career fair is really the experience that is meant to be gained from such an event. Most people I know did not get a job from a career fair at any point, and so although the chances of getting a job exist, the likelihood is still low which is why I never found them to be all that helpful. I still have a lot to learn in the ways of communication and interviewing, but having already interviewed and accepted 3 different internship positions during my education career makes me feel conifdent that the skills I have now would not be substantially increased by attending another career fair. It would be purely to find a job.

				<p class = "pText">
					At this point in my education and career I have successfully nabbed three internships out of four or so interviews. I am confident in my interview skills because of this. I think being confident about your skills, being excited to learn and add to the company, and being positive, warm, and willing to chat make for a memorable interviewee. My strategy so far has been to find common ground in some kind of background interest, at the TEP interview we talked about bicycles because my interviewer was a triathlete and I know a bit about off-road cycling. <br>
